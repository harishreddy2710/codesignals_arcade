def solution(param1, param2):
    return param1+param2



2.Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

Example

For year = 1905, the output should be
solution(year) = 20;
For year = 1700, the output should be
solution(year) = 17.


Solution:

def solution(year):
    return math.ceil(year/100)

3.Given the string, check if it is a palindrome.

Example

For inputString = "aabaa", the output should be
solution(inputString) = true;
For inputString = "abac", the output should be
solution(inputString) = false;
For inputString = "a", the output should be
solution(inputString) = true.


Solution:

# def solution(inputString):
#     s=""
#     for i in inputString:
#         s=i+s
#     return inputString==s

def solution(s):
    reversed_string=""
    for i in range(len(s)-1,-1,-1):
        # reversed_string + = s[i]
        if s==reversed_string:

5.Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.



Example

For n = 2, the output should be
solution(n) = 5;
For n = 3, the output should be
solution(n) = 13


Solution:

def solution(n):
    return n**2 +(n-1)**2


6.Ratiorg got statues of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster for his birthday, each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he likes to make things perfect, he wants to arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than the previous one exactly by 1. He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that. Help him figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed.

Example

For statues = [6, 2, 3, 8], the output should be
solution(statues) = 3.

Ratiorg needs statues of sizes 4, 5 and 7.

Solution:

def solution(statues):
    return max(statues)-min(statues)-len(statues)+1

7.Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
solution(sequence) = false.

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
solution(sequence) = true.

You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].

Solution:

def solution(sequence):
    fails1 = 0
    fails2 = 0
    
    for i in range(len(sequence)-1):
            if sequence[i] >= sequence[i+1]:
                fails1 = fails1 + 1
                
    for i in range(len(sequence)-2):
            if sequence[i] >= sequence[i+2]:
                fails2 = fails2 + 1
                
    if (fails1 < 2) and (fails2 < 2):
                
        return True
    else:
        return False 

8.After becoming famous, the CodeBots decided to move into a new building together. Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free, but there's a rumour that all the free rooms are haunted! Since the CodeBots are quite superstitious, they refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, or any of the rooms below any of the free rooms.

Given matrix, a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the cost of the room, your task is to return the total sum of all rooms that are suitable for the CodeBots (ie: add up all the values that don't appear below a 0).

Example

For

matrix = [[0, 1, 1, 2], 
          [0, 5, 0, 0], 
          [2, 0, 3, 3]]
the output should be
solution(matrix) = 9.

example 1

There are several haunted rooms, so we'll disregard them as well as any rooms beneath them. Thus, the answer is 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 9.

For

matrix = [[1, 1, 1, 0], 
          [0, 5, 0, 1], 
          [2, 1, 3, 10]]
the output should be
solution(matrix) = 9.

example 2

Note that the free room in the final column makes the full column unsuitable for bots (not just the room directly beneath it). Thus, the answer is 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 9.

Solution:

def solution(matrix):
    count=0
    for lis in zip(*matrix):
        for num in lis:
            if num==0:
                break
            count += num
    return count



9. Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.

Example

For inputArray = ["aba", "aa", "ad", "vcd", "aba"], the output should be
solution(inputArray) = ["aba", "vcd", "aba"].



Solution:

def solution(inputArray):
    maxstring=len(max(inputArray,key=len))
    return[word for word in inputArray if len(word)==maxstring]



10.Given two strings, find the number of common characters between them.

Example

For s1 = "aabcc" and s2 = "adcaa", the output should be
solution(s1, s2) = 3.

Strings have 3 common characters - 2 "a"s and 1 "c


Solution:


def solution(s1, s2):
    count = 0
    commons = set(s1) & set(s2)
    for i in commons:
        count += min(s1.count(i), s2.count(i))
    return count

11.Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.

Example

For n = 1230, the output should be
solution(n) = true;
For n = 239017, the output should be
solution(n) = false.


Solution:

def solution(n):
    n1=str(n)
    n2=len(n1)//2
    d1=[int(i)for i in n1[:n2]]
    d2=[int(i)for i in n1[-n2:]]
    if sum(d1)==sum(d2):
        return  True
    else:
        return False


12.Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!

Example

For a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180], the output should be
solution(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190]


Solution:

# def solution(a):
#     people = sorted(filter(lambda x: x != -1, a))
#     return [people.pop(0) if i != -1 else -1 for i in a]
    
    
def solution(a):
    people= sorted(filter(lambda x: x != -1, a),reverse=True)
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i]!=-1:
            a[i]=people.pop()
    return a

13.Write a function that reverses characters in (possibly nested) parentheses in the input string.

Input strings will always be well-formed with matching ()s.

Example

For inputString = "(bar)", the output should be
solution(inputString) = "rab";
For inputString = "foo(bar)baz", the output should be
solution(inputString) = "foorabbaz";
For inputString = "foo(bar)baz(blim)", the output should be
solution(inputString) = "foorabbazmilb";
For inputString = "foo(bar(baz))blim", the output should be
solution(inputString) = "foobazrabblim".
Because "foo(bar(baz))blim" becomes "foo(barzab)blim" and then "foobazrabblim".

Solution:

def solution(inputString):
    for i in range(len(inputString)):
        
        if inputString[i]=="(":
            start=i
        if inputString[i]==")":
            end=i
            return solution(inputString[:start]+inputString[start+1:end][::-1]+inputString[end+1:])
    return inputString

14.Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams. The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1 again, the fourth into team 2, and so on.

You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people. Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1, and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.

Example

solution(a) = [180, 105].

Solution:


def solution(a):
    return sum(a[::2]),sum(a[1::2])

           "ded"]
the output should be

solution(picture) = ["*****",
                      "*abc*",
                      "*ded*",
                      "*****"]



Solution:

   # def solution(picture):
#     output=[]
#     border=""
#     for i in range(0,len(picture[0])+2):
#         border+="*"
#     output.append(border)
#     for i in range(0,len(picture)):
#         output.append("*"+picture[i]+"*")
#     output.append(border)
#     return output
def solution(picture):
    lis=[]
    n=len(picture[0])
    lis.append("*"*(n+2))
    lis.extend("*"+x+"*" for x in picture)
    lis.append("*"*(n+2))
    return lis



16.Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.

Example

For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [1, 2, 3], the output should be
solution(a, b) = true.

The arrays are equal, no need to swap any elements.

For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [2, 1, 3], the output should be
solution(a, b) = true.

We can obtain b from a by swapping 2 and 1 in b.

For a = [1, 2, 2] and b = [2, 1, 1], the output should be
solution(a, b) = false.

Any swap of any two elements either in a or in b won't make a and b equal.


Solution:

def solution(A, B):
    return sorted(A)==sorted(B) and sum([a!=b for a,b in zip(A,B)])<=2

    sum = 0
    q = inputArray[0]
    for i in inputArray[1:]:
        if i <= q:
            sum += q-i+1
            q = q+1
        else:
            q = i
    return sum


18.Given a string, find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

Example

Solution:

def solution(inputString):
   return sum([inputString.count(i)%2 for i in set(inputString)])<=1


19.Call two arms equally strong if the heaviest weights they each are able to lift are equal.

Call two people equally strong if their strongest arms are equally strong (the strongest arm can be both the right and the left), and so are their weakest arms.

Given your and your friend's arms' lifting capabilities find out if you two are equally strong.

Example

For yourLeft = 10, yourRight = 15, friendsLeft = 15, and friendsRight = 10, the output should be
solution(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;
For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15, and friendsRight = 10, the output should be
solution(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;
For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15, and friendsRight = 9, the output should be
solution(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = false.

Solution:

def solution(inputArray):
    r=inputArray
    return max([abs(r[i]-r[i+1]) for i in range(len(r)-1)] )


21.An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. There are two versions of the Internet protocol, and thus two versions of addresses. One of them is the IPv4 address.

Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.

Example

For inputString = "172.16.254.1", the output should be
solution(inputString) = true;

For inputString = "172.316.254.1", the output should be
solution(inputString) = false.

316 is not in range [0, 255].

For inputString = ".254.255.0", the output should be
solution(inputString) = false.

There is no first number.


Solution:


def solution(inputString):
    p = inputString.split(".")
    return len(p) == 4 and all(n.isdigit() and 0 <=int(n)<256 and str(int(n))==n for n in p)


22.You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.

Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.

Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.

Example

For inputArray = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9], the output should be
solution(inputArray) = 4.

Check out the image below for better understanding:



Solution:

def solution(inputArray):
  for i in range(2,max(inputArray)+2):
    if i not in inputArray and all(j%i!=0 for j in inputArray):
      return i


23.Last night you partied a little too hard. Now there's a black and white photo of you that's about to go viral! You can't let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply the box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its content.

The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way: Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value of the pixel values from the 3 × 3 square that has its center at x, including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.

Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.

Example

For

image = [[1, 1, 1], 
         [1, 7, 1], 
         [1, 1, 1]]
the output should be solution(image) = [[1]].

To get the value of the middle pixel in the input 3 × 3 square: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 15 / 9 = 1.66666 = 1. The border pixels are cropped from the final result.

For

image = [[7, 4, 0, 1], 
         [5, 6, 2, 2], 
         [6, 10, 7, 8], 
         [1, 4, 2, 0]]
the output should be

solution(image) = [[5, 4], 
                  [4, 4]]
There are four 3 × 3 squares in the input image, so there should be four integers in the blurred output. To get the first value: (7 + 4 + 0 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 10 + 7) = 47 / 9 = 5.2222 = 5. The other three integers are obtained the same way, then the surrounding integers are cropped from the final result.


Solution:


def solution(image):
    r=len(image)
    c=len(image[0])
    ans=[]      
    for i in range(1,r-1):
        row=[]
        for j in range(1,c-1):
            row.append(sum([image[i+k][j+l]for k in [-1,0,1] for l in [-1,0,1]])//9)
        ans.append(row)
    return ans

solution(n, firstNumber) = 7.



Solution:

def solution(n, firstNumber):
    return (int(n / 2) + firstNumber) % n


31.You have deposited a specific amount of money into your bank account. Each year your balance increases at the same growth rate. With the assumption that you don't make any additional deposits, find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific threshold.

Example

For deposit = 100, rate = 20, and threshold = 170, the output should be
solution(deposit, rate, threshold) = 3.

Each year the amount of money in your account increases by 20%. So throughout the years, your balance would be:

year 0: 100;
year 1: 120;
year 2: 144;
year 3: 172.8.
Thus, it will take 3 years for your balance to pass the threshold, so the answer is 3.



Solution:

def solution(deposit, rate, threshold):
    return math.ceil(math.log(threshold/deposit, 1+rate/100))


# def solution(deposit, rate, threshold):
#     year = 0
#     while deposit < threshold:
#         deposit += deposit * rate/100
#         year += 1
#     return year


32.Given a sorted array of integers a, your task is to determine which element of a is closest to all other values of a. In other words, find the element x in a, which minimizes the following sum:

abs(a[0] - x) + abs(a[1] - x) + ... + abs(a[a.length - 1] - x)
(where abs denotes the absolute value)

If there are several possible answers, output the smallest one.

Example

For a = [2, 4, 7], the output should be solution(a) = 4.

for x = 2, the value will be abs(2 - 2) + abs(4 - 2) + abs(7 - 2) = 7.
for x = 4, the value will be abs(2 - 4) + abs(4 - 4) + abs(7 - 4) = 5.
for x = 7, the value will be abs(2 - 7) + abs(4 - 7) + abs(7 - 7) = 8.
The lowest possible value is when x = 4, so the answer is 4.

For a = [2, 3], the output should be solution(a) = 2.

for x = 2, the value will be abs(2 - 2) + abs(3 - 2) = 1.
for x = 3, the value will be abs(2 - 3) + abs(3 - 3) = 1.
Because there is a tie, the smallest x between x = 2 and x = 3 is the answer.


Solution:

def solution(a):
    sums = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sum = 0
        for j in range(len(a)):
            sum += abs(a[i] - a[j])
        sums.append(sum)
    return a[sums.index(min(sums))]


33.Given an array of equal-length strings, you'd like to know if it's possible to rearrange the order of the elements in such a way that each consecutive pair of strings differ by exactly one character. Return true if it's possible, and false if not.

Note: You're only rearranging the order of the strings, not the order of the letters within the strings!

Example

For inputArray = ["aba", "bbb", "bab"], the output should be
solution(inputArray) = false.

There are 6 possible arrangements for these strings:

["aba", "bbb", "bab"]
["aba", "bab", "bbb"]
["bbb", "aba", "bab"]
["bbb", "bab", "aba"]
["bab", "bbb", "aba"]
["bab", "aba", "bbb"]
None of these satisfy the condition of consecutive strings differing by 1 character, so the answer is false.

For inputArray = ["ab", "bb", "aa"], the output should be
solution(inputArray) = true.

It's possible to arrange these strings in a way that each consecutive pair of strings differ by 1 character (eg: "aa", "ab", "bb" or "bb", "ab", "aa"), so return true.


Solution:

from itertools import permutations as p
def solution(inputArray):
    p_list = list(p(inputArray))
    for i in range(len(p_list)):
        count1 = 0
        for j in range(len(p_list[0])-1):
            count2 = 0
            for k in range(len(p_list[0][0])):
                if p_list[i][j][k] != p_list[i][j+1][k]:
                    count2 +=1
            if count2 == 1:
                count1 +=1
        if count1 >= (len(p_list[0])) - 1:
            return True
    return False

34.Given array of integers, remove each kth element from it.

Example

For inputArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and k = 3, the output should be
solution(inputArray, k) = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10].


Solution:

def solution(inputArray, k):
    inp = []
    for i in range(len(inputArray)):
        if (i+1)%k == 0:
            pass
        else:
            inp.append(inputArray[i])
    return inp


35.Find the leftmost digit that occurs in a given string.

Example

For inputString = "var_1__Int", the output should be
solution(inputString) = '1';
For inputString = "q2q-q", the output should be
solution(inputString) = '2';
For inputString = "0ss", the output should be
solution(inputString) = '0'.

Solution:


def solution(inputString):
    c = [ i for i in inputString if i.isdigit() ]
    return c[0]


36.Given a string, find the number of different characters in it.

Example

For s = "cabca", the output should be
solution(s) = 3.

There are 3 different characters a, b and c.


Solution:

def solution(s):
    return len(set(s))


37.Given array of integers, find the maximal possible sum of some of its k consecutive elements.

Example

For inputArray = [2, 3, 5, 1, 6] and k = 2, the output should be
solution(inputArray, k) = 8.
All possible sums of 2 consecutive elements are:

2 + 3 = 5;
3 + 5 = 8;
5 + 1 = 6;
1 + 6 = 7.
Thus, the answer is 8.


Solution:

def solution(inputArray, k):
    # arr = [sum(inputArray[:k])]
    # for i in range(1, len(inputArray) - (k-1)):
    #     arr.append(arr[i-1] - inputArray[i-1] + inputArray[i + k - 1])
    # sort_arr = sorted(arr)
    # return sort_arr[-1]



    return max([sum(inputArray[i:k+i]) for i in range(len(inputArray) - k + 1)])



38.Caring for a plant can be hard work, but since you tend to it regularly, you have a plant that grows consistently. Each day, its height increases by a fixed amount represented by the integer upSpeed. But due to lack of sunlight, the plant decreases in height every night, by an amount represented by downSpeed.

Since you grew the plant from a seed, it started at height 0 initially. Given an integer desiredHeight, your task is to find how many days it'll take for the plant to reach this height.

Example

For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10, and desiredHeight = 910, the output should be
solution(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) = 10.

#	Day	Night
1	100	90
2	190	180
3	280	270
4	370	360
5	460	450
6	550	540
7	640	630
8	730	720
9	820	810
10	910	900
The plant first reaches a height of 910 on day 10.



Solution:


def solution(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight):
    day_count = 0
    height = 0
    while height <= desiredHeight:
        height = height + upSpeed
        day_count += 1
        if height < desiredHeight:
            height = height - downSpeed
        else:
            return day_count

39.You found two items in a treasure chest! The first item weighs weight1 and is worth value1, and the second item weighs weight2 and is worth value2. What is the total maximum value of the items you can take with you, assuming that your max weight capacity is maxW and you can't come back for the items later?

Note that there are only two items and you can't bring more than one item of each type, i.e. you can't take two first items or two second items.

Example

For value1 = 10, weight1 = 5, value2 = 6, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 8, the output should be
solution(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 10.

You can only carry the first item.

For value1 = 10, weight1 = 5, value2 = 6, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 9, the output should be
solution(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 16.

You're strong enough to take both of the items with you.

For value1 = 5, weight1 = 3, value2 = 7, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 6, the output should be
solution(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 7.

You can't take both items, but you can take any of them


Solution:


def solution(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW):
    if weight1 > maxW and weight2 > maxW and weight1 + weight2 > maxW:
        return 0
    if weight1 + weight2 <= maxW:
        return value1 + value2
    if value1 < value2:
        if weight2 > maxW:
            return value1
        else:
            return value2
    if value2 < value1:
        if weight1 > maxW:
            return value2
        else:
            return value1
    if value1 == value2:
        if weight1 > maxW:
            return value2
        else:
            return value1


40.Given a string, output its longest prefix which contains only digits.

Example

For inputString = "123aa1", the output should be
solution(inputString) = "123".


Solution:

def solution(inputString):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(inputString)):
        if inputString[i].isdigit():
            count += 1
        else:
            return inputString[0:count]
    return inputString



41.Let's define digit degree of some positive integer as the number of times we need to replace this number with the sum of its digits until we get to a one digit number.

Given an integer, find its digit degree.

Example

For n = 5, the output should be
solution(n) = 0;
For n = 100, the output should be
solution(n) = 1.
1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
For n = 91, the output should be
solution(n) = 2.
9 + 1 = 10 -> 1 + 0 = 1.


Solution:

def solution(n):
    degree = 0
    while 10 <= n:
        num = str(n)
        n = sum(int(i) for i in num)
        degree += 1
    return degree


42.Given the positions of a white bishop and a black pawn on the standard chess board, determine whether the bishop can capture the pawn in one move.

The bishop has no restrictions in distance for each move, but is limited to diagonal movement.


Solution:

def solution(bishop, pawn):
    if ord(bishop[0]) == ord(pawn[0]):
        return False
    else:
        bishop_elm = ord(bishop[0])+int(bishop[1])
        pawn_elm = ord(pawn[0])+int(pawn[1])
        return (bishop_elm + pawn_elm)%2 == 0


43.A string is said to be beautiful if each letter in the string appears at most as many times as the previous letter in the alphabet within the string; ie: b occurs no more times than a; c occurs no more times than b; etc. Note that letter a has no previous letter.

Given a string, check whether it is beautiful.

Example

For inputString = "bbbaacdafe", the output should be solution(inputString) = true.

This string contains 3 as, 3 bs, 1 c, 1 d, 1 e, and 1 f (and 0 of every other letter), so since there aren't any letters that appear more frequently than the previous letter, this string qualifies as beautiful.

For inputString = "aabbb", the output should be solution(inputString) = false.

Since there are more bs than as, this string is not beautiful.

For inputString = "bbc", the output should be solution(inputString) = false.

Although there are more bs than cs, this string is not beautiful because there are no as, so therefore there are more bs than as.



Solution:

def solution(inputString):
    counter = [inputString.count(i) for i in string.ascii_lowercase]
    return counter[::-1] == sorted(counter)


44.An email address such as "John.Smith@example.com" is made up of a local part ("John.Smith"), an "@" symbol, then a domain part ("example.com").

The domain name part of an email address may only consist of letters, digits, hyphens and dots. The local part, however, also allows a lot of different special characters. Here you can look at several examples of correct and incorrect email addresses.

Given a valid email address, find its domain part.

Example

For address = "prettyandsimple@example.com", the output should be
solution(address) = "example.com";
For address = "fully-qualified-domain@codesignal.com", the output should be
solution(address) = "codesignal.com"



Solution:


def solution(address):
    address_spl = address.split("@")
    c = [ i for i in address_spl ]
    if len(address_spl) == 2:
        return c[1]
    if len(address_spl) == 3:
        return c[2]


45.Given a string, find the shortest possible string which can be achieved by adding characters to the end of initial string to make it a palindrome.

Example

For st = "abcdc", the output should be
solution(st) = "abcdcba".


Solution:

def solution(st):
    for i in range(len(st)):
        sub = st[i:len(st)]
        if sub[::-1] == sub:
            missing = st[0:i]
            return st + missing[::-1]
    return 



46.Elections are in progress!

Given an array of the numbers of votes given to each of the candidates so far, and an integer k equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet, find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election.

The winner of the election must secure strictly more votes than any other candidate. If two or more candidates receive the same (maximum) number of votes, assume there is no winner at all.

Example

For votes = [2, 3, 5, 2] and k = 3, the output should be
solution(votes, k) = 2.

The first candidate got 2 votes. Even if all of the remaining 3 candidates vote for him, he will still have only 5 votes, i.e. the same number as the third candidate, so there will be no winner.
The second candidate can win if all the remaining candidates vote for him (3 + 3 = 6 > 5).
The third candidate can win even if none of the remaining candidates vote for him. For example, if each of the remaining voters cast their votes for each of his opponents, he will still be the winner (the votes array will thus be [3, 4, 5, 3]).
The last candidate can't win no matter what (for the same reason as the first candidate).
Thus, only 2 candidates can win (the second and the third), which is the answer.


Solution:

def solution(votes, k):
    max_vote = max(votes)
    len_vote = len(votes)
    if k == 0 and votes.count(max_vote) == 1:
        return 1
    return len([ i for i in range(len_vote) if votes[i] + k > max_vote ])


47.A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment.

The standard (IEEE 802) format for printing MAC-48 addresses in human-friendly form is six groups of two hexadecimal digits (0 to 9 or A to F), separated by hyphens (e.g. 01-23-45-67-89-AB).

Your task is to check by given string inputString whether it corresponds to MAC-48 address or not.

Example

For inputString = "00-1B-63-84-45-E6", the output should be
solution(inputString) = true;
For inputString = "Z1-1B-63-84-45-E6", the output should be
solution(inputString) = false;
For inputString = "not a MAC-48 address", the output should be
solution(inputString) = false.


Solution:


def solution(inputString):
    str_split = inputString.split("-")
    count = 0
    if len(inputString) != 17:
        return False
    if len(str_split) != 6:
        return False
    for i in range(0,6):
        if str_split[i] == "":
            return False
        if re.search('[a-zG-Z]', str_split[i]):
            count += 1
            if count > 0:
                return False
    return True



48.Determine if the given character is a digit or not.

Example

For symbol = '0', the output should be
solution(symbol) = true;
For symbol = '-', the output should be
solution(symbol) = false.


Solution:

def solution(symbol):
    return symbol.isdigit()


49.Given a string, return its encoding defined as follows:

First, the string is divided into the least possible number of disjoint substrings consisting of identical characters
for example, "aabbbc" is divided into ["aa", "bbb", "c"]
Next, each substring with length greater than one is replaced with a concatenation of its length and the repeating character
for example, substring "bbb" is replaced by "3b"
Finally, all the new strings are concatenated together in the same order and a new string is returned.
Example

For s = "aabbbc", the output should be
solution(s) = "2a3bc".



Solution:


from itertools import groupby
def solution(s):
    s2 = ""
    for k,g in groupby(s):
        l = len(list(g))
        if l == 1:
            s2 += k
        else:
            s2 += str(l) + k
    return s2


50.Given a position of a knight on the standard chessboard, find the number of different moves the knight can perform.

The knight can move to a square that is two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally away from it. The complete move therefore looks like the letter L. Check out the image below to see all valid moves for a knight piece that is placed on one of the central squares.



Solution:


import itertools as t
def solution(cell):
    knight_dir = list(t.permutations([1,2,-1,-2],2))
    knight_dir1 = []
    valid_moves = 0
    for i in range(len(knight_dir)):
        if sum(knight_dir[i]) != 0:
            knight_dir1.append(knight_dir[i])
    for x,y in knight_dir1:
        if (97 <= ord(cell[0]) + x <= 104) and (1 <= int(cell[1]) + y <= 8):
            valid_moves += 1
    return valid_moves



51.Given some integer, find the maximal number you can obtain by deleting exactly one digit of the given number.

    return max



52.Define a word as a sequence of consecutive English letters. Find the longest word from the given string.

Example

For text = "Ready, steady, go!", the output should be
solution(text) = "steady".


Solution:


def solution(text):
    word_split = re.findall(r"[\w']+", text)
    longest_word = ''
    for word in word_split:
        if len(word) > len(longest_word) and word.isalpha():
            longest_word = word
    return longest_w


53.Check if the given string is a correct time representation of the 24-hour clock.

Example

For time = "13:58", the output should be
solution(time) = true;
For time = "25:51", the output should be
solution(time) = false;
For time = "02:76", the output should be

Solution:


def solution(time):
    time_split = time.split(":")
    if 00 <= int(time_split[0]) <= 23 and 00 <= int(time_split[1]) <= 59:
        return True
    return False



54.CodeMaster has just returned from shopping. He scanned the check of the items he bought and gave the resulting string to Ratiorg to figure out the total number of purchased items. Since Ratiorg is a bot he is definitely going to automate it, so he needs a program that sums up all the numbers which appear in the given input.

Help Ratiorg by writing a function that returns the sum of numbers that appear in the given inputString.

Example

For inputString = "2 apples, 12 oranges", the output should be
solution(inputString) = 14.



Solution:


def solution(inputString):
    def getNumbers(str):
        nums = re.findall(r'[0-9]+', str)
        return nums
    numbers = getNumbers(inputString)
    total = 0
    for i in numbers:
        total += int(i)
    return total

56.Given an integer product, find the smallest positive (i.e. greater than 0) integer the product of whose digits is equal to product. If there is no such integer, return -1 instead.

Example

For product = 12, the output should be
solution(product) = 26;
For product = 19, the output should be
solution(product) = -1.



Solution:


def solution(product):
    if product == 0:
        return 10
    if product == 1:
        return 1
    for i in range(0, 4000):
        p = 1
        for j in str(i):
            p *= int(j)
        if p == product:
            return i
    return -1


57.You are given an array of strings names representing filenames. The array is sorted in order of file creation, such that names[i] represents the name of a file created before names[i+1] and after names[i-1] (assume 0-based indexing). Because all files must have unique names, files created later with the same name as a file created earlier should have an additional (k) suffix in their names, where k is the smallest positive integer (starting from 1) that does not appear in previous file names.

Your task is to iterate through all elements of names (from left to right) and update all filenames based on the above. Return an array of proper filenames.

Example

For names = ["doc", "doc", "image", "doc(1)", "doc"], the output should be solution(names) = ["doc", "doc(1)", "image", "doc(1)(1)", "doc(2)"].

Since names[0] = "doc" and names[1] = "doc", update names[1] = "doc(1)"
Since names[1] = "doc(1)" and names[3] = "doc(1)", update names{3} = "doc(1)(1)"
Since names[0] = "doc", names[1] = "doc(1)", and names[4] = "doc", update names[4] = "doc(2)"



Solution:

def solution(names):
    if names == []:
        return []
    new_names = []
    for name in names:
        if name not in new_names:
            new_names.append(name)
        else:
            for i in range(1,1000):
                new_name = name + '(' + str(i) + ')'
                if new_name not in new_names:
                    new_names.append(new_name)
                    break
    return new_names



58.You are taking part in an Escape Room challenge designed specifically for programmers. In your efforts to find a clue, you've found a binary code written on the wall behind a vase, and realized that it must be an encrypted message. After some thought, your first guess is that each consecutive 8 bits of the code stand for the character with the corresponding extended ASCII code.

Assuming that your hunch is correct, decode the message.

Example

For code = "010010000110010101101100011011000110111100100001", the output should be
solution(code) = "Hello!".

The first 8 characters of the code are 01001000, which is 72 in the binary numeral system. 72 stands for H in the ASCII-table, so the first letter is H.
Other letters can be obtained in the same manner.



Solution:


def solution(code):
    phrase = ""
    bits = [int(code[i*8:i*8+8],2) for i in range(len(code)//8)]
    for j in range(len(bits)):
        phrase += chr(bits[j])
    return phrase



59.Construct a square matrix with a size N × N containing integers from 1 to N * N in a spiral order, starting from top-left and in clockwise direction.

Example

For n = 3, the output should be

solution(n) = [[1, 2, 3],
                    [8, 9, 4],
                    [7, 6, 5]]



Solution:

def solution(n):
    dims = n
    elem = 1
    matrix = [ [0]*n for x in range(n) ]
    while 0 < dims:
        i = n - dims
        # you can sub i = n - dims ONLY in the first 2 parts
        # where n - dims is in the starting parameter of the range
        for j in range(n - dims, dims):
            matrix[i][j] = elem
            elem += 1
        for i in range(n - dims + 1, dims):
            matrix[i][j] = elem
            elem += 1
        for j in range(dims - 2, n - dims - 1, -1):
            matrix[i][j] = elem
            elem += 1
        for i in range(dims - 2, n - dims, -1):
            matrix[i][j] = elem
            elem += 1
        dims -= 1
    return matrix



60.Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

This algorithm should check if the given grid of numbers represents a correct solution to Sudoku.

Example

For
grid = [[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 9, 8, 7],
        [4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 1],
        [7, 9, 8, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 4],
        [9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 7, 6],
        [3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1, 9],
        [6, 8, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, 4, 3],
        [5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 3, 2],
        [2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8],
        [8, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]]
the output should be
solution(grid) = true;


Solution:



def solution(grid):
    for i in range(0,9):
        if sorted(grid[i]) != list(range(1,10)):
            return False
    for j in range(0,9):
        if sorted(grid[y][j] for y in range(9)) != list(range(1,10)):
            return False
    for i in range(0,9,3):
        for j in range(0,9,3):
            if sorted(grid[x][y] for x in range(i,i+3) for y in range(j,j+3)) != list(range(1,10)):
                return False
    return True
